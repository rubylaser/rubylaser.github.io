Andrea, just released the latest version of SnapRAID. This version introduces split parity, which allows you to spread your parity files across numerous disks. This makes transitioning up to larger data disks much easier and can mitigate the need to buy larger disks just for parity. You can read more about [itâ€™s features here](https://sourceforge.net/p/snapraid/discussion/1677233/thread/0cdebeeb/). Also, I have updated my [SnapRAID tutorial to reflect the update to v11](/setting-up-snapraid-on-ubuntu/), and I have posted a [new sync script](/snapraid-split-parity-sync-script/) to work with the new split parity.
