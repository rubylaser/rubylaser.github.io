# Statistics for Strava

I ride a lot, but it is easy to lose track of the bigger picture. Daily rides blur together and I tend to focus on what went wrong or what hurt the most. I wanted a way to see the longer story and track how my riding has changed over time and leverage all the data from my headunit to Strava. Setting up [statistics-for-strava](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/statistics-for-strava) gave me that view.  

I spun up the tool on my server and connected it with my Strava account. The setup took some trial and error, but once the data started pulling in, the dashboard gave me clear insight into my patterns. I now have a page that automatically updates with my rides and gives me more context than the default Strava app.  

The first thing that stood out was my mileage over the past year. I could see which months I pushed harder and which ones fell flat. Elevation gain told another story and showed me that most of my climbing has been packed into a handful of weeks. Seeing the totals made me more aware of when I am slacking and when I am on pace to reach my goals.  

Gear tracking was another surprise. I knew which bike I was using most, but the numbers showed exactly how many miles each one carried. That helps me plan for maintenance and replacement instead of just guessing. It also confirmed that my Canyon Endurace is putting in most of the work.  

Heatmaps gave me perspective on my routes. It was obvious where I feel most comfortable riding and where I have been avoiding. Having that laid out makes it easier to set new challenges. If I can see the gaps on the map, I can fill them in with fresh rides instead of circling the same old loops.  

What I like about hosting this myself is the control. I can add the stats I care about, save snapshots of charts, and even drop them into posts like this one. It helps me write about my rides with more detail and keeps me accountable to what I set out to do each season.  

Looking ahead, I want to keep using these numbers to push toward my century goal. The stats are not just about looking back. They are about shaping the next ride and the one after that. Having a clearer view of my distance, elevation, and effort helps me keep moving forward.
