In my ongoing quest to [optimize my Canyon Endurace CF7](/posts/customizing-my-bike/) for gravel riding, I recently made some significant upgrades that have already improved my comfort and control. After experiencing hand numbness and awkward wrist positions with the stock 44cm dropbar, I decided to switch to a smaller 40cm Zipp Speed Weaponry Service Course SL-70 XPLR dropbar.

### Removal and Installation

First, I removed the old tape and dropbar. The next step was to install the new Zipp bar. I took care to apply thread locker to all my stem bolts and torqued them to 5Nm, using carbon paste to prevent any unwanted movement.

### Shifter Setup

With the new bar in place, I leveled and installed the Shimano 105 shifters, ensuring they were positioned perfectly for my riding style. To keep the hydraulic brake and shifter lines tidy, I used strapping tape to secure them along the bar.

### Bartape Challenge

Wrapping the new bartape was a bit intimidating. The foam-based Lizard Skin tape I chose came with specific instructions about not stretching it. I think I took that a bit too seriously at first, resulting in a few attempts before I figured out how to stretch it just enough for a good bond with the handlebars. Ultimately, the wrap turned out well, and I was thrilled with how it felt during my last ride.
