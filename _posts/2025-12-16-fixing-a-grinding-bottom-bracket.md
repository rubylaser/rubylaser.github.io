Gravel and water are relentless. They don’t care how well sealed your components are or how carefully you wash your bike. Eventually, they find a way in.

After a season of thousands of miles on the gravel raid trails, my **Token Ninja pressfit bottom bracket** was done. The bearings were binding badly, felt gritty no matter how much I cleaned around them, and the cranks had that unmistakable *something’s wrong* resistance. My original plan was to press out the bearings and upgrade to **Enduro MR 2437 LLU/LLB A5** cartridges.

That plan didn’t survive contact with reality.

Instead of throwing more time and money at a system that had already proven vulnerable, I pulled the Token Ninja completely. I'm glad that I did. My bike had approximately 5 pounds of gravel and small stones inside of the frame that I was able to remove.

 After getting that out, I went with a **one-piece BB Infinite BB86**, using their **CeramiTec bearings**. It took more effort than expected to install, but the result was absolutely worth it.

## Why I abandoned the bearing swap idea

On paper, swapping bearings made sense. In practice:

- The Token Ninja cups had already seen grit and moisture.
- Even with upgraded bearings, the **two piece press-fit design** still relies on multiple interfaces that can move, creak, or let contamination in.
- I didn’t want to be back in the same spot after another year of riding on gravel roads/trails.

BB Infinite’s one piece design appealed to me for a few reasons:

- A **single, solid shell** that aligns both bearings perfectly
- No plastic cups
- Much tighter tolerances
- A reputation for staying quiet and spinning freely in rough real world conditions

If I was going to pull the whole thing apart anyway, I wanted a more permanent fix.

## Installation challenges I didn’t expect

This is where things got interesting.

The **BB Infinite BB86 is a true one piece unit**, which means it has to slide through the shell in one clean, uninterrupted motion. Anything that is in the way, is a problem. On my Canyon Endurace, two things got in the way: the rear brake line and the rear derailleur guide.  I needed to slightly reoute the brake line and use some of my needle files to file down the top edge of the guide.

## Installing the BB Infinite BB86

With clearance issues solved, the actual install went smoothly:

1. I started the bracket squarely on the non-drive side and aligned it by hand.
2. You don't apply any grease or Vibratite at this point.
3. Used a bearing press (Master Press MTS1-01-SS) to push the bb into the frame slowly and evenly.

4. Pressed until it was half way in and lose. Then, I aligned the cup on the drive side by hand. Making sure that all edges of the bb were square and visible.

5. At this point, you apply a thin coating of Vibratite on the bracket on the non-drive side and on the cup on the drive side.
6. Now, you finish pressing.  Once, it's done, add the dust caps.

Because it’s a single piece, alignment is automatic once it’s square going in. No fighting with opposing cups or hoping things line up.

## Reinstalling the crankset

Reassembly was standard:

- Reinstalled crank spindle and arms
- Set Magene preload
- Torqued pinch bolt to 14mm
- Torqued preload to 12mm
- Torqued preload innner bolt to 12mm

And then came the moment of truth. It was AWESOME! Spinning for days...

## The result: better than it’s ever been

The difference was immediate and obvious.

- Cranks spin **freely and silently**
- No gritty feel
- No resistance
- No play

This is, without exaggeration, the **best my cranks have ever felt** on this bike. Even compared to when it was new, the drivetrain feels dramatically smoother.

There’s also a mental benefit: I’m no longer wondering when the next creak or grind is going to show up after a muddy ride.

Now, get out there and ride!
