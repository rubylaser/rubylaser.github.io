## Rediscovering My Passion for Cycling

Cycling was a significant part of my childhoodâ€”a symbol of freedom and the thrill of speeding down the neighborhood streets. As life took over, my bike was replaced by golf clubs, and my passion for pedaling became a distant memory. It wasn't until my kids grew up and needed bikes of their own that I found myself back in the saddle, albeit a bit more cautiously this time around.

## A Journey Back to Fitness

After a challenging period in my life, I made a commitment to myself to get back in better physical and mental shape. I began with long walks and worked my way up to 10 miles. At this time, I also, tentatively, started cycling again. I was out of practice and started with modest 3-mile trips. Despite the challenges, I fell in love with cycling all over again. The sense of freedom was palpable, reminiscent of my carefree youth.

## Overcoming Challenges

I am fortunate to live near a series of interconnected trails that are almost 150 miles in total. These trails are converted railway lines that stretch through scenic views and quiet paths. This became my refuge, my place to rebuild my strength and spirit. However, an old knee injury reared its head again during some yardwork, bringing with it a sharp pain and instability. This time, determined to not let it sideline me, I sought medical advice. An MRI revealed arthritis, swollen bursae, and a significant strength imbalance between my legs. This diagnosis led to months of physical therapy, a challenging yet transformative experience.

## A New Chapter with a "Real" Bike

During my recovery, I stumbled upon a great deal for a high-quality bike. This was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. This new bike wasn't just a purchase; it was an incentive, a motivation to get stronger and push my limits. I picked up a Canyon Endurace CF7 Disk with an 11-speed Shimano 105 drivetrain. This bike feels like a rocket ship compared to my older, aluminum hybrid bike.

## Today: Longer Rides and New Challenges

Today, I'm still working on strengthening my left leg, but I've made incredible progress. I've managed rides up to 75 miles and recently competed in my first gravel race, the Dirty 30. These experiences have not just been about physical endurance but personal triumphs over the adversities of life.

## Conclusion

Cycling has given me more than just physical fitness; it has provided a path to emotional recovery and personal growth. Each ride is a reminder of where I've been and a celebration of where I'm going. I look forward to many more miles, enjoying every pedal stroke of freedom and every challenge along the way.
