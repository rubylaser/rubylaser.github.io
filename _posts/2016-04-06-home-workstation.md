## Workstation Upgrades

I just updated my home workstation to something much more powerful than what I had in the past. With 8-core hyperthreaded Xeon e5-2760’s going for $60, I decided it was time to upgrade. The following is the build components. All of these parts were either re-used from other systems I had or purchased used from eBay at a HUGE discount.

**CASE:** Coolermaster 912HAF  
**PSU:** Coolermaster SilentPro 600 watt  
**MOBO:** Supermicro X9SRL-F  
**CPU:** Intel Xeon e5-2670 v1  
**CPU FAN:** Supermicro SNK-P0050AP4 (narrow ILM)  
**FANS:** 3 x Noctua SSO NF-S12B redux-1200 PWM  
**RAM:** 8 x 8GB sticks of Hynix DDR3 ECC RAM (64GB total)  
**GPU:** EVGA 750TI  
**HD:** Intel S3500 300GB  
**CARDS:** Mellanox Connect X-2 10GBe Ethernet with Avago Transcievers and 10 meter fiber to the server in the basement  
**MONITOR:** HP Pavilion 27xw 27 inch IPS LED monitor

This makes for a very quiet, very powerful workstation. The only other things I added were a PCIe USB3 card, and a USB sound card as the Supermicro server board doesn’t have sound built-in. The onboard IPMI, and fan controls make for a very nice setup.

I’m also able to use the 750TI to play emulators with my kids and lightweight Steam gaming (No high-end titles).
