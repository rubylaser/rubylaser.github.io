## Introduction to fdupes
I knew I could use fdupes to identify the dupes, but I wanted to replace them with hardlinks. Iâ€™ve seen many bash scripts that pipe the output from fdupes -r to view them. On newer distros, Ubuntu 12.04, fdupes has a -L option that will replace the duplicates with hardlinks.

```bash
 apt-get install fdupes 
```

```bash
 fdupes -r -L /marketing 
```

On older versions of Ubuntu 10.04 the -L option does not exist. I grabbed and compiled a newer version of fdupes from [this repository](https://github.com/tobiasschulz/fdupes) to support the -L option.
