Rubylaser Design and Coding was founded by me, Zack Reed, about 15 years ago. I’ve always enjoyed new technologies, and was thrilled at the opportunity to be paid to learn and develop an application in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) many years ago. I’ve been developing applications ever since then. Ranging from Content Management Systems (CMS), E-Commerce, Material Procurement Systems, and even webcam security systems.

I create cleanly coded, standards compliant websites with optimal test coverage through a series of iterations and proactive communication with my clients.

I can help you connect with your target audience using tools like SEO while providing you a clean CMS to administrate your content easily.
